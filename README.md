> A Vue.js project

Implementation of the Bob exercise from Exercism
http://exercism.io/submissions/08515840c01846adb68851d4f5001895

## Rules

Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.

Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.

He answers 'Whoa, chill out!' if you yell at him.

He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying anything.

He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.

## Build Setup


``` bash
#clone repo
git clone the repository and cd into the folder

# install dependencies
run npm install on your terminal to install dependencies

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev to run web server locally

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
